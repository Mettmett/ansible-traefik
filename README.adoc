== Goals

Little Ansible role to install Traefik from official GitHub repository, with a simple configuration.

== What remains to be done ?

- use handlers
- create ansible tags
- create a verify test/molecule
- add your value!

== Vars

Some variables are used in the file `main.yml`. Change the value of `traefik_version` and `traefik_log_file`, don't forget to use it in your configurations files.

== How to use it ?

=== Test it with molecule

Simple ! Use the venv.sh script to enter to the matrix (c).

```bash
source venv.sh
```

This virtualenv will bring you needed tools. You will in the virtualenv automatically. You are now ready to create virtual machines.

```bash
molecule create
```

And then use the playbook

```bash
molecule converge
```

When you're all set, destroy it.

```bash
molecule destroy
```

=== Use this role in another ansible playbook

*NEED FIX*

Incorpore this role on your playbook and go !

```bash

```
